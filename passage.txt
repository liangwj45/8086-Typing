  My aim in life is to save the environment for future generations.
  I want to become an environmental consultant after I graduate.
  Too many people think that pollution cannot be stopped if we want
the country to develop.
  But that is not true. We can cut back on dangerous and dirty waste
from factories.
  Even though a factory produces a large quantity of goods, it does
not mean that it has to pump a lot of pollution into the environment.
  I want to teach people to buy products that have been recycled, as
well.
  This is much better for the environment, because it means we do not
need to cut down as many trees.
  Companies and businesses can still operate, but the Earth will not
have to suffer.
  There is no debating that we also have a problem with population.
  The number of people in the world keeps growing, and we are
producing more rubbish and using up more raw materials.
  What if they run out?
  I am confident that if we are all watching to work together, we can
overcome these challenges and keep the Earth clean and healthy.
